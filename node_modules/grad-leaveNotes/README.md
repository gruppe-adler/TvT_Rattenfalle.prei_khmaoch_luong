## Dependencies
* [CBA_A3](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3)
* [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3)


## Installation
### Manually
1. Create a folder in your mission root folder and name it `modules`. Then create one inside there and call it `grad-leaveNotes`.
2. Download the contents of this repository ( there's a download link at the side ) and put it into the directory you just created.
3. see step 3 below in the npm part

### Via `npm`
_for details about what npm is and how to use it, look it up on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)_

1. Install package `grad-leaveNotes` : `npm install --save grad-listbuymenu`
2. Prepend your mission's `description.ext` with `#define MODULES_DIRECTORY node_modules`
3. Append the following lines of code to the `description.ext`:

```sqf
#include "node_modules\grad-leaveNotes\grad_leaveNotes.hpp"

class CfgFunctions {
    #include "node_modules\grad-leaveNotes\cfgFunctions.hpp"
};

class CfgSounds {
	sounds[] = {};
    #include "node_modules\grad-leaveNotes\cfgSounds.hpp"
};
```


## Usage
Using the notes system is fairly intuitive. Open up your ACE selfinteraction menu, go to "Equipment", "Notes" and choose "Write Note". A notepad will open up. Write whatever you like, then hit "SAVE" to put the note into your virtual inventory or hit "DROP" to place it on the ground. Use your ACE interaction key to read, pick up or destroy notes on the ground. Use your selfinteraction menu and go to "Equipment", "Notes" again to read, drop or destroy notes in your virtual inventory.

Use this function to enable/disable a unit to write notes (default is true):  
`[unit, allow] call GRAD_leaveNotes_fnc_allowWriting;`

Use this function to enable/disable a unit to inspect notes (default is true):  
`[unit, allow] call GRAD_leaveNotes_fnc_allowInspection;`

Use this function to set how many notes a unit can write (default is 10):  
`[unit, amount] call GRAD_leaveNotes_fnc_setAmount;`

All of these function have to be called either on server or or client where unit is local.

| Parameter | Type | Explanation |
| ----------|------|-------------|
| unit      | object | The unit this applies to |
| allow     | bool   | Enable or disable this ability |
| amount    | number | Amount of notes this unit can write. (Does not add to remaining amount.) |
